# Netflix Clone

This project is a static clone of the Netflix homepage, created using only HTML and CSS. It replicates the visual design of the Netflix interface, including the layout, typography, and styling, without any JavaScript or backend functionality.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout:** The design adjusts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **CSS Styling:** Mimics the look and feel of Netflix, including the navbar, hero section, movie thumbnails, and footer.
- **Static Content:** All content is static and manually added, as this project focuses purely on HTML and CSS.

## Demo

https://netflix-indiaclone.vercel.app/

## How It Works

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the page, including sections for the navbar, featured content, movie thumbnails, and footer.
- **CSS**: Styles the page to match Netflix's design, including layout, colors, fonts, and hover effects.

## Usage

To view the Netflix clone, simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhishekabysm/netflix-clone.git
cd netflix-clone
open index.html
```

## Files

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the Netflix clone.
- `style.css`: Contains the CSS styling for the Netflix clone.

## Customization

You can customize the clone by modifying `style.css` to change colors, fonts, or layout, and by editing `index.html` to add or replace content.

## Limitations

- **No Interactivity:** This project does not include JavaScript, so features like carousels, search, and login forms are not functional.
- **Static Content:** All images and text are placeholders and do not link to actual content.
